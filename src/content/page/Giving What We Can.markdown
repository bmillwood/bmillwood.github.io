title: Giving What We Can review
---
GWWC has a good story for being a very important cause to work on. I've 
never been extremely excited or impressed by their insight or 
accomplishments, though. I haven't yet worked out what they would do 
differently if they had more money.

## What do they do?

> Giving What We Can is a community of effective givers. We inspire 
> people to donate significantly and as effectively as possible.

Traditionally they also did research but that's spinning down now:

> Within global health and development, we will move to simply 
> recommending GiveWell’s top charities, rather than curating an 
> independent but overlapping list of recommended charities based in 
> large part on their research (as we do now).

GWWC produced the Pledge, and tracked subscribees to it, and stuff like 
MyGiving, which helps encourage people (provides accountability) but 
also helps measure GWWC's own impact and the effectiveness of the 
Pledge.

GWWC run the GWWC Trust, which simplifies donating for many people and 
provides tax-deductibility to UK donors for some non-UK organisations. 
This is the only reason I use it, so that I can donate to GiveDirectly 
and DtWI. It's not clear to me how common that is as a reason for using 
the Trust or how much money is redirected from tax payments in this way, 
although we know that &gt;$1m goes through the 
trust[<sup>1</sup>](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/fundraising/#what-we-do-trust). 
(Unanswered question: how much social good does it do to redirect £x 
from tax payments to charity?)

### ["Our Impact"](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/impact/)

GWWC have a page where they basically calculate the money redirected to 
effective charity by them, and divide it by their costs. I think this is 
an interesting thing to do, but it's basically a red herring, especially 
as they acknowledge an expectation that their costs will increase as 
they attempt to grow more in the future. We don't expect an additional 
dollar will earn $104 for effective charities. In fact, it's not clear 
from this page what an additional dollar will even pay for.

There's a link from there to the most recent [fundraising 
report](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/fundraising) which seems like a 
better place to go to find out what's going on, although it hasn't been 
updated since the CEA merger. (Curiously, it looks like the "Quick 
Stats" **are** updated: they say 1929 members, while the text says "over 
1300").
