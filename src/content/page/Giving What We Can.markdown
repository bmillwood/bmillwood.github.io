title: Giving What We Can review
---
GWWC has a good story for being a very important cause to work on. I've 
never been extremely excited or impressed by their insight or 
accomplishments, though. I haven't yet worked out what they would do 
differently if they had more money.

## What do they do?

> Giving What We Can is a community of effective givers. We inspire 
> people to donate significantly and as effectively as possible.

Traditionally they also did research but that's spinning down now:

> Within global health and development, we will move to simply 
> recommending GiveWell’s top charities, rather than curating an 
> independent but overlapping list of recommended charities based in 
> large part on their research (as we do now).
> 
> [*Some Organisational Changes at the Centre for Effective Altruism*](http://effective-altruism.com/ea/zn/some_organisational_changes_at_the_centre_for/)

GWWC produced the Pledge, and tracked subscribees to it, and stuff like 
MyGiving, which helps encourage people (provides accountability) but 
also helps measure GWWC's own impact and the effectiveness of the 
Pledge.

GWWC run the GWWC Trust, which simplifies donating for many people and 
provides tax-deductibility to UK donors for some non-UK organisations. 
This is the only reason I use it, so that I can donate to GiveDirectly 
and DtWI. It's not clear to me how common that is as a reason for using 
the Trust or how much money is redirected from tax payments in this way, 
although [we know that &gt;$1m goes through the 
trust](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/fundraising/#what-we-do-trust). 
(Unanswered question: how much social good does it do to redirect £x 
from tax payments to charity? Tax money on average probably does more 
good than my spending money (or my unspent money!), but how much? At the 
same time, some would certainly argue that there are government projects 
whose budget would be better served even being redirected to, say, the 
bottom of the sea.)

### ["Our Impact"](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/impact/)

GWWC have a page where they basically calculate the money redirected to 
effective charity by them, and divide it by their costs. I think this is 
an interesting thing to do, but it's basically a red herring, especially 
as they acknowledge an expectation that their costs will increase as 
they attempt to grow more in the future. We don't expect an additional 
dollar will earn $104 for effective charities. In fact, that page isn't 
a great place to find out what an additional dollar will do at all.

There's a link from there to the most recent [fundraising 
report](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/fundraising) which seems like a 
better place to go, although it hasn't been updated since the CEA 
merger. (Curiously, it looks like the "Quick Stats" **are** updated: 
they say 1929 members, while the text says "over 1300", and the PDF says 
1386).

Given it's about eight months since this report, my guess is I should 
just talk to GWWC directly about what's happened since then. But in the 
meantime, let's find out what their plans were.

The report discusses:

* Community building
* GWWC Trust
* Research
* Reaching potential members
* Building a network of chapters

Let's examine what each will do with more money:

#### Community building

> Central office organises a number of events each year: we recently 
> passed half a billion dollars pledged and plan to host a celebratory 
> party in early 2016 to remind members of the good they are doing and 
> the extent to which the community is growing.

This is probably good but not inspiring, and feels a tiny bit indulgent. 
It's fine to have indulgences, but I'm not excited about funding them.

> We also reach out to new members, offering them a Skype conversation 
> with a member of staff: over the past year we have spoken to almost 
> 200 members in this way.

These do sound useful – getting people talking leads to good things, and 
GiveWell's recently had the same idea. It also has an obvious cost, in 
staff time.

#### The trust

> To that end, the Giving What We Can Trust was launched at the 
> beginning of 2014 to facilitate tax-efficient donations to top 
> charities.

I hadn't realised it was *specifically* for tax efficiency. In light of 
that it seems a *little* bit odd that they don't try to measure the 
amount of money moved directly from tax to charity by these means. 
Although admittedly that's not super straightforward. If I couldn't give 
tax-efficiently to those US charities, I might just have given more to 
AMF instead. That might even be a win? It certainly would have made my 
bookkeeping easier!

Anyway, there's clearly *some* value here, even if it isn't 
straightforwardly the value of all tax that was deducted by virtue of 
giving via the Trust.

They're thinking of setting up a US trust as well. This seems also like 
a good thing, although I don't know a bunch about US taxes.

#### Research

Per the above this doesn't seem like it's going to continue in its 
current form. Which I think is probably a net win. In the future, it 
could be nice to have more than one GiveWell, to form a more independent 
consensus and lessen the chances of systematic error. But I'd guess 
(fairly baselessly) that we're not at the stage where that's the most 
efficient use of resources.

It's interesting to see how the fundraising prospectus for Winter 2015 
doesn't appear to have anticipated that shift, and seems very much about 
how totally important their research is. I think GWWC perhaps lacks the 
well-developed instinct that (say) GiveWell has for critically 
evaluating the usefulness (or otherwise) of its own programs. Or perhaps 
it does have that instinct, but it's slightly less open / public about 
it. They do, to their credit, mention that GiveWell is also in the space 
and "increasingly professionalized", but I'd like to have seen more said 
about the perceived value added there. Perhaps it's moot now.

Anyway, the research team at GWWC is going to continue to exist (after 
some restructuring / reshuffling) and they're proceeding as follows:

> Our main focus within charitable research will be experimenting with a 
> new project: boutique philanthropic advice to major donors. We’ve 
> found that there is notable demand for evidence-based charity research 
> from major donors who, for a variety of reasons, do not want simply to 
> support GiveWell’s top charities or to work with Open Philanthropy. 
> (Often, the donor is interested in a particular cause area, such as 
> disaster preparedness, that is different from the work of GiveWell’s 
> top charities.) 

On the face of it there's certainly potential for serious impact here. 
It seems a valuable thing to be doing. I have a mild concern that we're 
compromising on cause-neutrality here, but if we can't turn people 
cause-neutral, then ensuring their cause-partial actions are based on 
sound evidence and thoughtful analysis is *probably* still a win. If it 
comes to finding the most effective method of treating some 
exceptionally rare disease or solving some basically unburdensome 
problem, though, that seems like we've turned the wrong way.

Anyway I've written a lot about this in proportion to how much we 
actually know about what it will look like.

The "organisational changes" post also mentions that *some* traditional 
work, in areas not covered by GiveWell, may continue (although we have 
to wonder, *why* aren't those areas covered by GiveWell?) and also – 
more intriguingly – there's the prospect of some fundamentals research. 
My intuition is to be somewhat excited about fundamentals research, but 
slightly skeptical – the right time to do fundamentals research to me 
seems like when you've already got some field experience and a concrete 
context in which to frame it. We're probably approximately there but 
it's not totally obvious when it's going to earn the most payoff.

There's also the "Oxford Institute for Effective Altruism" on the way, 
but by the sounds of it that's grant-funded and so not directly relevant 
to the question of whether to donate.
