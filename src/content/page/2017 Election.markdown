## High expectations for Theresa May

1. Why was Theresa May polling so well before the election?
2. I think I've heard she was polling better than the Conservative party 
   as a whole. Is this true, and if so why?
3. Given #2, her strategy of focusing on herself and not her policies, 
   having a "presidential-style" race, seemed like a smart one. What 
   went wrong?

## Low expectations for Corbyn

What led to those expectations?

1. Bad polling
2. A perception (genuine or not) among the media and politicians that 
   Corbyn was a bad politician or a bad leader
3. Party infighting, high turnover

The first two certainly feed each other. My perception is that #2 came 
first and was visible pretty much as soon as he was introduced into the 
leadership race.

Can we do anything to compare opinions of Corbyn with opinions of 
Labour?

### Did Corbyn only do well relative to expectations, or overall as well?

Corbyn got a greater vote share versus the 2015 election, but... so did 
May. (See "Collapse of third-party votes").

More people went Con → Lab than went Lab → Con.

### Did Corbyn only do well because May did badly?

* Con party manifesto was not costed (do people care?)
* "Dementia tax" blunder, U-turn
* "I will not hold an election" U-turn

Were these mistakes substantively larger than the normal background 
level of mistakes?

I guess it would be productive to look at by-time polling numbers and 
compare them with when these things occurred. But I don't know if people 
who change their minds *because* of blunders like that change them 
*immediately after* said blunders.

## Collapse of third-party votes

### UKIP

It seems likely that UKIP's vote share was always going to collapse:

* They were a single-issue party whose main goal seems to have been 
  acheived,
* They lost their charismatic figurehead, and the rest of them seem 
  mostly useless.

About half went to the Cons, less than 20% to Labour. As proportions of 
the whole, that's about 7% of voters going UKIP → Con, and about 2% 
going UKIP → Lab (in each case, less than half a percent total go the 
other way).

### SNP

This one was more of a surprise (to me at least), and particularly the 
extent to which people went Cons, who traditionally (as I understand it) 
have been a lost cause in Scotland.

I wildly conjecture that the SNP just managed to capture the zeitgeist 
before and didn't manage to do it again, so this year's performance is 
more "regression to the mean" than a dramatic failure. After all, as was 
widely pointed out, it was near-impossible for the SNP to do *better* 
than 2015.
