## High expectations for Theresa May

1. Why was Theresa May polling so well before the election?
2. I think I've heard she was polling better than the Conservative party 
   as a whole. Is this true, and if so why?
3. Given #2, her strategy of focusing on herself and not her policies, 
   having a "presidential-style" race, seemed like a smart one. When and 
   why did that stop looking true?

## Low expectations for Corbyn

What led to those expectations?

1. Bad polling
2. The media and politicians claimed (sincerely or not) that Corbyn was 
   a bad politician or a bad leader
3. Party infighting, high turnover made Labour appear to lack competence 
   or expertise

The first two certainly feed each other. My perception is that #2 came 
first and was visible pretty much as soon as he was introduced into the 
leadership race.

Can we do anything to compare opinions of Corbyn with opinions of 
Labour? That could help assign blame/credit for the dip and then rise in 
fortunes.

### Did Corbyn only do well relative to expectations, or overall as well?

Corbyn got a greater vote share than Ed did in the 2015 election, but... 
May improved on DC too. (See "Collapse of third-party votes").

More people went Con → Lab than went Lab → Con. That seems like a 
measure of overall success.

### Did Corbyn only do well because May did badly?

* Con party manifesto was not costed (do people care?)
* "Dementia tax" blunder and U-turn
* "I will not hold an election" U-turn

Were these mistakes above the normal background level of political 
disasters?

I guess it would be productive to look at by-time polling numbers and 
compare them with when these things occurred. But I don't know if people 
who change their minds *because* of blunders like that change them 
*immediately after* said blunders.

Hoe does she measure up to Davey C of 2015 or 2010? Do the above only 
look like blunders (over and above the background rate of political 
blunders) because we already know her support nosedove?

## Collapse of third-party votes

### UKIP

It seems likely that UKIP's vote share was always going to collapse:

* They were a single-issue party whose main goal seems to have been 
  acheived,
* They lost their charismatic figurehead, and the rest of them seem 
  mostly useless.

About half went to the Cons, less than 20% to Labour. As proportions of 
the whole, that's about 7% of voters going UKIP → Con, and about 2% 
going UKIP → Lab (in each case, less than half a percent total go the 
other way).

### SNP

This one was more of a surprise (to me at least), and particularly the 
extent to which people went Cons, who traditionally (as I understand it) 
have been a lost cause in Scotland.

I wildly conjecture that the SNP just managed to capture the zeitgeist 
before and didn't manage to do it again, so this year's performance is 
more "regression to the mean" than a dramatic failure. After all, as was 
widely pointed out, it was near-impossible for the SNP to do *better* 
than 2015.

Maybe it would be better to compare against 2010 instead.
