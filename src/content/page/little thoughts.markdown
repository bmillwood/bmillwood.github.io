**2016-08-27 22:47 HKT**: "It is easier to regret what you didn't do 
than what you did". But is that suggesting the regret-minimising 
approach of doing things rather than not doing them, or that it's harder 
to see the benefit of not doing something, harder to see harm 
averted, so we should always adjust towards that direction knowing its 
virtue is usually understated?

movement can seem like creation, when you take a lit flashlight into a 
dark building. Well I thought it was good anyway :/

**2016-08-23 00:11 HKT:** People often focus on the conflict between 
"give" and "take", altruism versus selfishness. But both are just moving 
things around. From a certain perspective, both are often irrelevant, 
and the real alternative is "make".

WordPress? Really?

**2016-08-20 00:59 HKT:** "Worse is better" seems to have some serious 
weight, some real power behind it as an idea. Which is unfortunate, 
because worse isn't better. It's worse.
