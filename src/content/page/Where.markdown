title: Where should I give?
---
I am trying to work out where to give a large-ish amount over the next 
week or two. I currently pay UK tax at the 40% rate, so UK-deductibility 
gives a 5/3 multiplier on donation value.

## Causes

The main question I'm trying to answer here is "direct or meta?"

Meta makes bold claims about itself, and intuitively it does seem like 
well-run meta organisations could have seriously high impact 
multipliers. But it feels like there's lower accountability there – who 
evaluates the evaluators? Well, they do at least evaluate themselves.

## Direct organisations

### Against Malaria Foundation

Traditional favourite and recommended by GiveWell. Most of my money goes 
here at the moment. There's been some suggestion that they're doing some 
deals right now and money right now is particularly important.

## Meta organisations

### GWWC

See [their page](/page/Giving What We Can.html).

### 80k

80k's website is excellent, and I've been to one of their careers talks 
and it was also excellent. My naïve assessment is that they're on the 
ball. However, their cause isn't as obviously urgent in my eyes – their 
impact doesn't seem as obviously / consistently direct.

### GiveWell

I'm not sure what GiveWell actually needs is more money. Plus they're 
not UK-tax deductible anyway.
