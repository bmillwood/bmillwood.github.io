I am trying to work out where to give approx. £90k to UK-tax deductible 
charities (or, in principle, places at least 70% more compelling).

# Causes

The main question I'm trying to answer here is "direct or meta?"

Meta makes bold claims about itself, and intuitively it does seem like 
well-run meta organisations could have seriously high impact 
multipliers. But it feels like there's lower accountability there – who 
evaluates the evaluators? Well, they do at least evaluate themselves.

# Organisations

## Direct

### Against Malaria Foundation

Traditional favourite and recommended by GiveWell. Most of my money goes 
here at the moment. There's been some suggestion that they're doing some 
deals right now and money right now is particularly important.

## Meta

### Giving What We Can

GWWC has a good story for being a very important cause to work on. I've 
never been extremely excited or impressed by their insight or 
accomplishments, though. I haven't yet worked out what they would do 
differently if they had more money.

### 80k

80k's website is excellent, and I've been to one of their careers talks 
and it was also excellent. My naïve assessment is that they're on the 
ball. However, their cause isn't as obviously urgent in my eyes – their 
impact doesn't seem as obviously / consistently direct.

### GiveWell

I'm not sure what GiveWell actually needs is more money.
