        <p>This is an editable tree-structure list implemented with React /
        Redux.</p>
        <p>Next things I would work on if I spent more time on it:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>I don't use npm or compile anything, so I can't use
            import/export. This means you can't see that (e.g.) editableList
            comes from state.js without just going and finding it.</li>
          <li>There turns out to only really be one component, so many of the
            interesting aspects of React/Redux aren't really exercised. I could
            conceivably split each line (managing editability, for example)
            into its own component.</li>
          <li>Use production versions of the dependencies and/or compile them in.</li>
          <li>More features, like moving subtrees around.</li>
          <li>Persisting stuff locally or on the server (the latter would require something more featureful than github.io).</li>
          <li>Concurrent edits with other clients (likewise).</li>
        </ul>
