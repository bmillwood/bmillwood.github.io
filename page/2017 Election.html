<ol type="1">
<li>Why was Theresa May polling so well before the election?</li>
<li>I think I’ve heard she was polling better than the Conservative party as a whole. Is this true, and if so why?</li>
<li>Given #2, her strategy of focusing on herself and not her policies, having a “presidential-style” race, seemed like a smart one. When and why did that stop looking true?</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="low-expectations-for-corbyn">Low expectations for Corbyn</h2>
<p>What led to those expectations?</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Bad polling</li>
<li>The media and politicians claimed (sincerely or not) that Corbyn was a bad politician or a bad leader</li>
<li>Party infighting, high turnover made Labour appear to lack competence or expertise</li>
</ol>
<p>The first two certainly feed each other. My perception is that #2 came first and was visible pretty much as soon as he was introduced into the leadership race.</p>
<p>Can we do anything to compare opinions of Corbyn with opinions of Labour? That could help assign blame/credit for the dip and then rise in fortunes.</p>
<h3 id="did-corbyn-only-do-well-relative-to-expectations-or-overall-as-well">Did Corbyn only do well relative to expectations, or overall as well?</h3>
<p>Corbyn got a greater vote share than Ed did in the 2015 election, but… May improved on DC too. (See “Collapse of third-party votes”).</p>
<p>More people went Con → Lab than went Lab → Con. That seems like a measure of overall success.</p>
<h3 id="did-corbyn-only-do-well-because-may-did-badly">Did Corbyn only do well because May did badly?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Con party manifesto was not costed (do people care?)</li>
<li>“Dementia tax” blunder and U-turn</li>
<li>“I will not hold an election” U-turn</li>
</ul>
<p>Were these mistakes above the normal background level of political disasters?</p>
<p>I guess it would be productive to look at by-time polling numbers and compare them with when these things occurred. But I don’t know if people who change their minds <em>because</em> of blunders like that change them <em>immediately after</em> said blunders.</p>
<p>Hoe does she measure up to Davey C of 2015 or 2010? Do the above only look like blunders (over and above the background rate of political blunders) because we already know her support nosedove?</p>
<h2 id="collapse-of-third-party-votes">Collapse of third-party votes</h2>
<h3 id="ukip">UKIP</h3>
<p>It seems likely that UKIP’s vote share was always going to collapse:</p>
<ul>
<li>They were a single-issue party whose main goal seems to have been acheived,</li>
<li>They lost their charismatic figurehead, and the rest of them seem mostly useless.</li>
</ul>
<p>About half went to the Cons, less than 20% to Labour. As proportions of the whole, that’s about 7% of voters going UKIP → Con, and about 2% going UKIP → Lab (in each case, less than half a percent total go the other way).</p>
<h3 id="snp">SNP</h3>
<p>This one was more of a surprise (to me at least), and particularly the extent to which people went Cons, who traditionally (as I understand it) have been a lost cause in Scotland.</p>
<p>I wildly conjecture that the SNP just managed to capture the zeitgeist before and didn’t manage to do it again, so this year’s performance is more “regression to the mean” than a dramatic failure. After all, as was widely pointed out, it was near-impossible for the SNP to do <em>better</em> than 2015.</p>
<p>Maybe it would be better to compare against 2010 instead.</p>
