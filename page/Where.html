<p>I am trying to work out where to give approx. £90k to UK-tax deductible charities (or, in principle, places at least 70% more compelling).</p>

<p>The main question I’m trying to answer here is “direct or meta?”</p>
<p>Meta makes bold claims about itself, and intuitively it does seem like well-run meta organisations could have seriously high impact multipliers. But it feels like there’s lower accountability there – who evaluates the evaluators? Well, they do at least evaluate themselves.</p>

<p>Traditional favourite and recommended by GiveWell. Most of my money goes here at the moment. There’s been some suggestion that they’re doing some deals right now and money right now is particularly important.</p>

<p>GWWC has a good story for being a very important cause to work on. I’ve never been extremely excited or impressed by their insight or accomplishments, though. I haven’t yet worked out what they would do differently if they had more money.</p>
<h3 id="k">80k</h3>
<p>80k’s website is excellent, and I’ve been to one of their careers talks and it was also excellent. My naïve assessment is that they’re on the ball. However, their cause isn’t as obviously urgent in my eyes – their impact doesn’t seem as obviously / consistently direct.</p>

<p>I’m not sure what GiveWell actually needs is more money. Plus they’re not UK-tax deductible anyway.</p>
